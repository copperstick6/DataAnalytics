    "\n",
    "Compared to other developed countries, the United States has low voter turnout rates. About 55.5% of the U.S. voting-age population casted ballots in the 2016 presidential election. In the 2000 presidential election, the turnout rate was 50.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fearing another low turnout in the 2002 midterm elections, civic groups in Iowa and Michigan launched the Vote 2002 Campaign to boost voter turnout. In the week prior to the election, Vote 2002 volunteers called 60,000 voters on the phone and gave them the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Hello, may I speak with [name of person] please? Hi. This is [caller's name] calling from Vote 2002, a nonpartisan effort working to encourage citizens to vote. We just wanted to remind you that elections are being held this Tuesday. The success of our democracy depends on whether we exercise our right to vote or not, so we hope you'll come out and vote this Tuesday. Can I count on you to vote next Tuesday?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our causal question of interest is: **Did the Vote 2002 campaign work? Did it increase voter turnout in the 2002 Congressional elections?** \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the causal effect of receving a Vote 2002 phone call, we'll need to compare the outcomes of voters that received a call--we'll call them **contacted** voters--to the outcomes for some comparison group. For our causal effect estimate to be accurate, the comparison group we use will need to reflect the *counterfactual* outcomes for contacted voters: what those voters *would have* done if they had not received the Vote 2002 call. If the comparison group poorly represents the counterfactual, our estimate will be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the comparison group to represent the counterfactual, we need the only relevant difference between contacted voters and comparison voters to be that comparison voters did not receive a phone call while contacted voters did. We will first use regression to adjust for observed differences between the contacted and comparison groups. We will then compare results from this regression-based approach to what we get from a randomized experiment.\n",

    "## Section 1: The Dataset <a id='data'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we'll use was compiled by the Vote 2002 campaign staff. The staff had demographic data for each voter they attempted to contact, and marked whether each call was completed successfully or not. Later, in order to measure the impact of their campaign, they merged these data with official voting records to see if voters did go out and vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a description of each column in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `contact` - indicator for whether voter was successfully contacted by volunteer\n",
    "* `vote02` - indicator for whether the voter votes in the 2002 election (*this is the outcome of interest*)\n",
    "* `vote98` - indicator for whether the voter voted in the 1998 election\n",
    "* `newreg` - indicator for wheter voter is newly registered voter\n",
    "* `age` -  age of voter\n",
    "* `female` - indicator for female\n",
    "* `county`: county code\n",
    "* `treatment`: we'll discuss this one later\n",
